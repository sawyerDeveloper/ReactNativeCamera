# Facts
The app has a login page that has some validation if you don't use the correct U/P Test/test.

There is some basic animation on the login page.

The Capture page loads after you log in.

Tapping your screen takes a picture and then you can click 'Keep' and it will save to your Camera Roll or 'Retry' to take a new pic.
